# Vehicle-storage-project

First try to create a Java program to save information about parked vehicles.

The program is designed to store information about vehicles of a parking lot that wants to save these data (make, model, year, cost, hp/cc).

**First**: Define an ***abstract*** class named **"Vehicles"** that contains the main structure for our information and include a method to represent this information quickly.

**Second**: Implements two other ***classes*** to handle different types of vehicles, **"Car"** and **"Bike"**, to manage the storing data according to them.

**Lastly**: Create an ***interface class*** named **"Parking"** just to announce if a vehicle is or is not parked in the parking lot.



***My clarification:***
* *You may find some of these informations not so related to the project. This happens because i wanted to try more thinks about Object-oriented programming, and see how they work.*
